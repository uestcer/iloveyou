suprised to your gril friend. :>

of tomcat. Lanuching tomcat server.Inputing the web address of "http://localhost:8080/iloveyou" on the browser.The username and password are "iloveyou" and you can login to see the whole website.

##Usage##
I agree that It's not necessary to repeat what others have did. And I 
have used many web pages which gether from the internet. They are very pretty and all have a cool design. Many thanks for the creator.

This is a common Java Web project.You might have some revamps before you use it.
eg: the name,picture and word and at all.
	罗密欧->your name
	朱丽叶->her name

You just need use the WebRoot and src to replace  appropriate directory. All of the static pages are in the directory of /WebRoot/home, and different model have different Working directory.Fellowing is the map of the model and the directory:
	

- 爱你<-->/WebRoot/home/iloveyou
	

- 相册<-->/WebRoot/home/album
	

- 有趣<-->/WebRoot/home/interest


- 烟火<-->/WebRoot/home/fireworks
	

- 晚安<-->/WebRoot/home/goodnight

But what I want to empharize is that I'm not good at Web development and especially in Front End. Factly, most of my time are concentrated on background development.I do it just for fun. Most web pages of this project are get from internet, and I just put them together.If you have any questions or proposals you can contact me by the email:cfreestar@163.com.
